Difference between a Physical and a Virtual address

    The main difference between physical memory and virtual memory is that physical memory point to real memory location in RAM, 
    when  virtual memory consist virtual adress. Virtual adress are mapped to the physcial adresses at execution time. 
    That means that virtual memory can be large than physical. 
    This approach can help us to solve the problem of program accommodation.
